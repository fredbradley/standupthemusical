<meta property="og:description" content="&#8216;STAND UP &#8211; The Musical&#8217; is a brilliant new show that brings together the worlds of comedy and musical theatre for the first time! It tells the story, both on stage and off, of three comedians at different stages in their careers. Hilarious Stand Up routines are intertwined in a story that shows the ups &amp; downs, pitfalls and inside dealings of the world of TV, comedy and entertainment and exposes their jaw dropping antics!
Darren Day as Tony Monroe, Billy Pearce as Stan Chester and brand new comic actor Owain Williams as Scott Thomas are 3 comedians all looking for the same thing! Lionel Blair is the canny and ruthless, but hilarious agent Oliver Squires and Brookside&#8217;s Dean Sullivan is the wise and witty Comedy Club Manager Bob Fletcher. Award winning Anthony Williams, who breaks box office records at the Floral every Christmas directs and choreographs.
A full supporting cast of West End performers and singers come together for this limited run that combines the very best in stand up comedy and musical theatre with a hysterically funny new musical score by Daryl Denham and Maurice Cheetham.
Performances:
7.30pm on Tuesday 3rd &#8211; Friday 6th September
2pm and 7.30pm on Saturday 7th September 2013.
Tickets £25.00 and £23.00 (concessions)
